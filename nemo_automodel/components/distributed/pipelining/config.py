"""Pipeline parallel configuration class.

Design principle:
- Device mesh (world_mesh, moe_mesh) is passed separately to from_pretrained/from_config
- PipelineConfig contains scheduling, splitting, and runtime options
- loss_fn is included here since it's only used for pipelining
- Axis names are inferred automatically from device_mesh in _instantiate_pipeline

Usage:
    from nemo_automodel.components.distributed.pipelining.config import PipelineConfig

    config = PipelineConfig(
        pp_schedule="1f1b",
        pp_microbatch_size=2,
        pp_batch_size=8,
        loss_fn=my_loss_fn,
    )

class PipelineConfig:
    """
    Configuration for pipeline parallel training.

    Note: Device mesh (world_mesh, moe_mesh) is passed separately on the
    from_pretrained/from_config method signature. Pipeline parallelism is
    enabled when pp_size > 1. Axis names are inferred automatically from
    the device mesh structure.

    Attributes:
        pp_schedule (Optional[str]): Pipeline schedule type. Supported values:
            "1f1b" (one-forward-one-backward), "gpipe", "interleaved_1f1b",
            "looped_bfs", "dfs", "v_schedule", "zero_bubble". Defaults to "1f1b".
        pp_schedule_csv (Optional[str]): Path to a CSV file defining a custom
            pipeline schedule. If provided, overrides pp_schedule.
        pp_microbatch_size (int): Size of each microbatch for pipeline execution.
            pp_batch_size must be divisible by pp_microbatch_size.
        pp_batch_size (int): Total batch size per pipeline stage. Must be
            divisible by pp_microbatch_size.
        layers_per_stage (Optional[int]): Number of transformer layers per
            pipeline stage. If None, layers are split evenly across stages.
        round_virtual_stages_to_pp_multiple (Optional[Literal["up", "down"]]):
            When using virtual stages (interleaved schedules), round the number
            of virtual stages to a multiple of pp_size. "up" rounds up, "down"
            rounds down. If None, no rounding is applied.
        module_fqns_per_model_part (Optional[List[List[str]]]): Explicit
            specification of which module FQNs belong to each model part/stage.
            If provided, overrides automatic layer splitting.
        patch_inner_model (bool): Apply pipeline patches to the inner model
            (e.g., the base transformer in a CausalLM wrapper). Defaults to True.
        patch_causal_lm_model (bool): Apply pipeline patches to the CausalLM
            wrapper model. Defaults to True.
        patch_stage_backward_maybe_with_nosync (bool): Patch stage backward to
            use no_sync context for gradient accumulation efficiency. Useful
            when combining PP with FSDP.
        dtype (Optional[torch.dtype]): Data type for pipeline computation.
            If None, uses the model's default dtype.
        scale_grads_in_schedule (bool): Scale gradients within the pipeline
            schedule (by 1/n_microbatches). If False, gradients must be scaled
            externally. Defaults to False.
        loss_fn (Optional[Callable]): Loss function used for pipeline training.
            Required when pipeline is enabled. The function signature should be
            compatible with the model's output format.
        pp_seq_len (Optional[int]): Sequence length hint for pipeline parallel
            shape inference. If None, it will be inferred from the dataset config.
        pp_recv_buffer_pool (bool): Pool the per-microbatch P2P recv buffers into
            a ring sized to the 1F1B in-flight depth instead of pre-allocating one
            buffer set per microbatch and direction. Cuts pipeline-stage buffer
            memory roughly by num_microbatches / (num_stages - stage_index + slack)
            on early/middle stages. Only applied for schedules with a bounded
            in-flight depth (currently "1f1b"); ignored with a warning otherwise.
            Defaults to False.
        pp_recv_buffer_pool_slack (int): Extra buffer sets beyond the 1F1B
            in-flight depth when pp_recv_buffer_pool is enabled. Defaults to 2.

    """Zero ``weight[row]`` in place without integer-indexing a DTensor.

    ``weight[row].zero_()`` on a DTensor whose vocabulary dim is sharded triggers a
    redistribute (an all-gather of the whole embedding) and fails outright for TP
    shards. This touches only the rank-local shard, and only when that shard owns
    the row.

    Args:
        weight: Embedding matrix of shape [vocab, hidden]; a plain tensor or a DTensor whose
            placements are ``Replicate`` / ``Shard`` on either matrix axis.
        row: Global row index to zero (negative indices count from the end).

    Returns:
        True when this rank held part of the row and zeroed it, False when the row
        lives entirely on other ranks.
